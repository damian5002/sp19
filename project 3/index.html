		<p class="centerandwidth" align="center">The Game Boy Advance SP is a big step for Nintendo. Not only did it generally improve upon the GBA design with a more compact and portable case, but also solved one of the biggest and longest standing problems with Nintendo's portables: a dark LCD. And although the frontlight is one of the most practical improvements for the system, that's hardly where the innovation stops.</p>
